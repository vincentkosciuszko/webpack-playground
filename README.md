# ðŸ“¦ Webpack 5 Scss & Javascript playground

A very simple boilerplate I use when I want to quickly scaffold an environment to work with javascript and sass.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/vnzko/webpack-playground ./my-idea
cd my-idea
yarn
```

## Usage

### Development server

This boilerplate use [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to serv the generated files.

```
yarn start
```

You can access to the server at [`localhost:1111`](http://localhost:1111/)

### Development build

```
yarn dev
# or use the watcher
yarn watch
```

The files are available in the `wwwroot` folder.

### Production build

As the name suggests it's a **playground** and it isn't supposed to build thing that go in production. That is why there is no production build.
